## About this repo
This Github repository was created for the Data Analysis with Python sessions[1](https://dataharvesteijc2020.sched.com/event/dkjb/data-analysis-with-pandas-on-jupyter-1?iframe=no),[2](https://dataharvesteijc2020.sched.com/event/dkje/data-analysis-with-pandas-on-jupyter-2?iframe=no),[3](https://dataharvesteijc2020.sched.com/event/dkjh/data-analysis-with-pandas-on-jupyter-3?iframe=no) during the [DataHarvest+](https://dataharvest.eu) European Investigative Journalism Conference. During three session of about an hour, we took participants through the process of retrieving, cleaning, analysing, transforming, combining and visualising a dataset in the Jupyter environment. These were a showcase sessions, but you could follow along in your own time, by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) and our notebooks which are all stored in this repo.

<br>**Article on Altair and its upsides**

<br>About Altair vs Matplotlib: 
- mathplotlib is a classic; you should probably learn a little bit of this too;
- mathplotlib needs less code to create a chart;
- altair has a clearer syntax;
- altair is better at interactivity;
- altair charts can be adjusted in many many ways (also: more code ;) )

<br>There are other libraries you can use to make charts: ggpy, bokeh, seaborn, plotly. All of them have slightly different advances. When you're beginning, simply pick one and learn it. :)
